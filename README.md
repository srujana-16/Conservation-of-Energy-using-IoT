# Conservation of energy using a conveyor belt
## Overview

 
 
* Ultrasonic sensor senses the distance of object every 0.3 seconds
* When the distance sensor becomes zero on the left side, clockwise conveyor belt motor is triggered.
* The object is lifted up the left ramp by conveyor belt.
* The conveyor belt stops when the object reaches the top of the left ramp. 
* The object now falls down freely on the right ramp, its distance is again sensed by the right side distance sensor
* Again when the distance sensor becomes zero, the motor of conveyor belt is triggered, but this time in anticlockwise direction. And the loop continues.
